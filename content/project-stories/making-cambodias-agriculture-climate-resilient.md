Around 80 percent of the population in Cambodia depends on rainfed agriculture for livelihood. As the country is highly vulnerable to climate change, droughts and erratic precipitation lead to unstable yields and food insecurity. Exacerbating this are poor infrastructure and a range of capacity and policy constraints that result in fragmented agricultural value chains. 

This is why Ms. Hak Meng, an accountant at the Samaki Amatak Agricultural Cooperative in Kampot Province, Cambodia, only had two wishes: a good road that connects the communes and a warehouse to store their rice seeds and harvests. Her wishes were answered when the country started implementing the Climate-Friendly Agribusiness Value Chains Sector Project (CFAVC) in late 2019. 

With total funding of $141 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Project aims to make Cambodia's agricultural sector more resilient and competitive in the face of climate change. It was the first project in Cambodia to receive GCF funding and also the first project to be implemented following the adoption of the Strategy for Promoting Safe and Environment-Friendly Agro-based Value Chains in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and Siem Reap Action Plan, 2018–2022. The project has a five-year implementation period and was scheduled for completion late 2024 but was extended until September 2026. 

The project aims to enhance the climate resilience of critical agriculture infrastructure and facilitating commercialization of four crops such as rice, maize, cassava, and mango production in four agricultural value chains in Kampong Cham, Tbong Khmum, Kampot, and Takeo provinces. Key activities of the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), in coordination with Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) and Ministry of Rural Development (MRD), include building storage and processing capacity, promoting solar and bioenergy, strengthening the technical and policy environments for agribusinesses, strengthening technical and institutional capacity for climate smart agriculture, and creating an enabling policy environment for climate-friendly agribusinesses. 

During an ADB Review Mission on July 1, 2025, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) presented its project accomplishments as of June 2025 based on three expected outputs:

* Critical agribusiness value chain infrastructure improved and made climate resilient.
* Climate-smart agriculture and agribusiness promoted.
* Enabling environment for climate-friendly agribusiness enhanced.

Among the initial progress made was the improvement of farm roads into climate-resilient standards to improve connectivity to cooperatives and markets. This made it easier to travel on the road, buy and sell rice, Ms. Meng of the Samaki Amatak Agricultural Cooperative said. The construction of a storage warehouse also increased the number of farmers buying their rice seeds, which led to more revenues for the cooperative. The income generated was used to buy and sell more rice, as well as to offer loans to farmers, and buy compost that members use as fertilizers.

To promote the use of renewable energy, 6,000 bio-digesters and compost hut units were also made operational, benefitting 40,000 people (50% of whom are women). The project also led to the use of climate-resilient varieties of rice and maize to boost local agribusiness, and the promotion of farm mechanization such as the use of laser land leveling. 

Nearly 30,000 farmers underwent training in climate-smart agriculture and agribusiness development skills, of which 46% were female. The project also led to the establishment of Farmer Water User Communities (FWUCs) and Farmer Water User Groups (FWUGs) to operate and maintain irrigation schemes, as well as agricultural development centers and engineering workshops.

Mr. Suon Ry, head of the Samaki Amatak Agricultural Cooperative, said the rehabilitation of the irrigation system enabled local farmers plant and harvest thrice a year instead of twice, as well as grow other crops aside from rice due to increased water supply availability. 

To foster and promote an environment for climate-friendly agribusiness, the project led to the formulation of policies on climate-smart and gender-responsive agribusiness and a Public-Private Partnership Framework. 

In addition to making Cambodia’s agricultural sector climate-resilient and competitive, the project is also expected to improve regional cooperation and trade in the Greater Mekong Subregion while showcasing ADB’s significant partnership with the GCF, particularly in incorporating advanced technologies in development projects in the Asia and Pacific region.
