Like many Small Island Developing States in the Pacific, Tonga is among the countries extremely vulnerable to the perils of climate change due to its low-lying islands. These climate impacts pose hazards to vital infrastructure, disrupting the country’s energy supply and access. Exacerbating Tonga’s situation is its heavy reliance on imported diesel, which accounts for 90 percent of its electricity generation. Thus, catalytic investments are needed to transform the country’s energy sector and infrastructure. 

To help Tonga reduce its fossil fuel dependence and shift to renewables, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded a project that aims to deliver utility-scale battery storage systems to provide base load response and grid stability. The Tonga Renewable Energy Project (TREP) is expected to stabilize the grid and address the intermittency of variable renewable energy sources. 

Norway, one of the largest contributors to GCF, supports projects like the TREP to help vulnerable communities address and adapt to the climate crisis. 

The video shows the Norway's Deputy Foreign Minister Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik inspecting a battery energy storage system in Tonga. “The Pacific island states are extremely vulnerable (to) the climate crisis so it's imperative that we're able to find solutions that can also benefit these states. It's been really wonderful to see some of the projects that are being undertaken here in in Tonga,” he said during his visit in September 2024. “We feel that we have a moral obligation, a legal obligation, a political obligation to assist our counterparts here in the Pacific, to help countries across the globe finding sustainable solutions in order to transition into a greener economy.” 

He added that Norway proudly supports the GCF and “it's important for us to see that the funds that we provide are allocated to robust and meaningful projects.”
