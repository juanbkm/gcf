Climate change is an urgent, wide-ranging global issue that needs to be further embedded in the work of all development partners. In Asia and the Pacific, which is bearing the brunt of the world’s worst climate-related disasters rapid growth in infrastructure investments could lead to significant increases in global greenhouse gas emissions.

Thus ADB is scaling up the delivery of climate financing to its developing member countries (DMCs) in the region, and increasing its pipeline of adaptation and mitigation projects. One of the focus areas under [ADB’s Strategy 2030](https://www.adb.org/about/strategy-2030-operational-priorities) is ramping up efforts to address climate change, disaster risks, and environmental degradation, while helping DMCs mitigate, and adapt to, climate change effects.

In support of these efforts, [ADB partnered with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and became an accredited entity to the GCF in 2015](https://www.greenclimate.fund/ae/adb).

The GCF is global funding platform established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in pursuit of the UNFCCC’s climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. With contributions from 49 countries regions, and cities, the GCF invests in projects, programs, and other activities implemented by partner organizations to promote low GHG emissions, and climate-resilient development, particularly in countries that are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

Based on the request of an ADB DMC, ADB can access GCF resources to co-finance ADB projects of any GCF funding category (type, size, risk category, and modality).

To date, GCF has approved a total funding of $1.696 billion for 14 ADB projects, comprising $681.4 million in grants and $1.015 billion in loans. Total project financing for all 14 projects is $9.06 billion.
