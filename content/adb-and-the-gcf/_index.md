Climate change is an urgent, wide-ranging global issue that needs to be further embedded in the work of all development partners. Asia and the Pacific is bearing the brunt of the world’s worst climate-related disasters. At the same time, the trajectory of its infrastructure investments could lead to significant increases in global greenhouse gas emissions. [ADB’s Strategy 2030](https://www.adb.org/about/strategy-2030-operational-priorities) makes ramping up efforts to address climate change, disaster risks, and environmental degradation, all while helping its developing member countries (DMCs) mitigate, and adapt to, climate change effects one of its focus areas.

ADB is committed to scaling up the delivery of climate financing to its developing member countries and increasing its pipeline of adaptation and mitigation projects.
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is global funding platform established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in pursuit of the UNFCCC’s climate-change mitigation and adaptation objectives. With contributions from 49 countries regions, and cities, the GCF invests in projects, programs, and other activities implemented by partner organizations, to promote low-GHG emission, climate-resilient development, particularly in countries that are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

[ADB is has been an accredited entity to the GCF](https://www.greenclimate.fund/ae/adb) since 2015 and—based on the request of an ADB developing member country—can access GCF resources to co-finance ADB projects of any GCF funding category (type, size, risk category, modality).
 
To date, GCF has approved a total funding of approximately $473 million for ten ADB projects, comprising around $231 million in grants and around $242 million in loans. ADB’s portfolio as an accredited entity makes up approximately 8.1% of total GCF project funding. Total project financing—including ADB and other co-financing—for all ten projects is $3.3 billion.
