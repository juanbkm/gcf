Climate change is an urgent, wide-ranging global issue that has been embedded in global developmental goals in the past decade. Given that Asia and the Pacific has been bearing the brunt of most of the world’s worst climate-related disasters, ADB’s new Strategy 2030 focuses on ramping up efforts to address climate change, disaster risks, and environmental degradation, all while helping its developing member countries (DMCs) mitigate, and adapt to, climate change’s effects.
ADB is committed to scaling up the delivery of climate financing to its developing member countries and increasing its pipeline.
The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is global funding platform was established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in pursuit of the UNFCCC’s climate-change mitigation and adaptation objectives. With donations from developed countries, the GCF invests in projects, programs, and other activities implemented by partner organizations, including ADB, to promote low-emission, climate-resilient development, particularly in countries that are highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

To date, GCF has approved a total funding of $473 million for 10  ADB projects, comprising $231 million in grants and $242 million in loans, making up approximately 8.1% of total GCF project funding. Total project financing for all 10 projects is $3.3 billion.
