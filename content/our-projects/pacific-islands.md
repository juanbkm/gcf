### Overview

Pacific Island Countries (PICs) are among the most climate-vulnerable regions globally due to its geographical and socioeconomic characteristics. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, increased intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones, accelerating sea level rise, and changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events—all brought about by climate change—significantly impact water security and freshwater availability in PICs. 

The project aims to help address acute water insecurity in four PICs: Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Tonga, and Vanuatu. Without intervention, their vulnerabilities to climate change could escalate and exacerbate health risks and economic burdens, especially in remote communities, schools, and healthcare facilities that lack safe drinking water.  

By financing the deployment of decentralized and renewably powered water systems, the project seeks to eliminate reliance on rainwater, groundwater, and transported alternatives. 

### Implementation

The project will finance the development, installation, and operation of up to 15,000 hydropanels across 1,000 sites in the four PICs, particularly in the rural and outer island communities.  

The project combines decentralized renewable technology, long-term equipment leasing, and local capacity building to create a financially viable, climate-resilient water security model. It targets approximately 100,000 direct beneficiaries in rural and outer island communities, especially schools and public institutions without access to safe drinking water.  

The project will be executed by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) wholly owned by SOURCE Global Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of SOURCE Global, which specializes in decentralized water technology and has delivered over 450 projects across 52 countries.  

The project utilizes SOURCE hydropanels, which generate clean drinking water by extracting moisture from the air using solar energy, replacing reliance on rainwater, groundwater, or bottled water. 

Some key activities include signing sustainable financial and operational agreements, installing decentralized solar-powered hydropanel systems, and ensuring long-term system sustainability through operations and maintenance. 

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The project demonstrates paradigm shift through the following: 
By reducing Pacific Island Countries' dependence on rainwater harvesting, groundwater extraction, and transported potable water, systemic change in climate-resilient water security is achieved. 

By demonstrating the viability of decentralized, off-grid water production integrated with long-term service agreements, the project establishes a scalable adaptation model that can be replicated in other climate-vulnerable regions.  

By introducing a commercially viable service model in which decentralized production is financed through blended capital and sustained by structured offtake agreements, ensuring operational continuity without requiring ongoing concessional funding. This also demonstrates structural transformation in how water security is financed and delivered: veering away from over-reliance on donor-funded infrastructure, public subsidies, or emergency water shipments.  

By embedding long-term financing into the water sector, the project creates a precedent for scaling decentralized models without reliance on large-scale, capital-intensive infrastructure projects.  

By aligning with national adaptation plans and climate resilience strategies, the project supports the mainstreaming of decentralized water production into government planning frameworks. This policy alignment, combined with demonstrated financial viability, increases the likelihood that similar models will be adopted and expanded by both the public and private sectors, ensuring that the paradigm shift extends beyond the direct impacts of the project itself.
