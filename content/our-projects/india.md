### Overview

With over 90% of its main energy supply still derived from fossil fuels, India ranks as the world’s third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Most of its cities’ air pollution levels exceed WHO air quality standards, putting public health at risk and worsening climate-related vulnerabilities.  
While it has been making significant progress and achieving rapid growth in renewable energy capacity, growing energy demand continues to outpace the deployment of clean energy solutions. By 2030, India’s energy demand is expected to increase by nearly 35%, requiring bold, targeted investments to scale emerging solutions beyond their current niche markets.

New solutions are thus needed to drive decarbonization in more complex sectors that are harder to decarbonize — the industrial sector, agriculture, and transportation — which consume nearly two-thirds of the country’s energy, and underserved regions key sectors and to scale up renewable energy.  

The prohibitive cost of technologies, lack of long-term use experience, high-risk premiums, and borrowers that cannot furnish collateral or need credit enhancement also make clean energy solutions hard to finance by making capital, inadequate, expensive and short-term.  

The India Green Finance Facility (IGFF) is designed to deliver precisely a paradigm shift by unlocking investment in high-impact, underfunded technologies and regions. 

### Implementation

The India Green Finance Facility (IGFF) was proposed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in partnership with India’s leading development finance institutions (DFIs).  

To accelerate India’s clean energy transition, IGFF will mobilize $200 million in concessional financing from GCF to leverage $1.9 billion from ADB and leading Indian DFIs, catalyzing $2.9 billion in financing for emerging clean energy technologies. It will also enable state-owned DFIs to offer loans to public and private sector borrowers to finance initiatives for decarbonization of the energy, transport, industry, and agriculture sectors, in the process institutionalizing green lending practices and driving large-scale gender-responsive investments.  

A $65-million risk sharing facility (RSF) will be established under the IGFF to provide partial credit guarantees and promote financing for MSME developers for the deployment of CBG. Additionally, technical assistance will be provided to build capacities of DFIs, MSME developers, and other financial institutions to institutionalize green lending practices within their operations.  

Key activities include providing DFIs with concessional credit lines for on-lending to public and private sector borrowers and establishing the RSF to promote investment in sectors aligned with India’s clean energy transition goals and national programs; and building the capacity of financial institutions in India to finance emerging clean energy technologies through technical assistance, policy engagement, and capacity-building initiatives. In addition, there will be a focus on ensuring climate finance principles and gender-responsive approaches are embedded into institutional practices.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The project is expected to help in the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, with support for 836 MW of new renewable energy capacity expected to reduce 50 million metric tons of CO2e over its lifetime.

By expanding clean energy access to underserved regions, the program will also enhance energy security, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels and stabilizing power supply for critical sectors. Beyond environmental benefits, IGFF is set to generate over 139,234 green jobs, fostering economic growth while improving air quality and reducing respiratory diseases, ultimately lowering healthcare costs.

It demonstrates paradigm shift potential through the following:

<ul>
<li>Transforming the financial system by addressing deep-rooted structural barriers in India’s clean energy finance landscape, introducing catalytic financial instruments, and mainstreaming climate-aligned practices across DFIs. IGFF also helps embed sustainability into the core of India’s financial system by aligning DFIs’ operations with India’s Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework.</li>
<li>Driving scalable, inclusive market transitions, with IGFF serving as a platform for replicable, bankable models in emerging sectors that are otherwise seen as too risky. The facility has a gender-responsive design that supports women-led energy enterprises and inclusive product development, so the benefits of the clean energy transition reach underserved groups.</li>
</ul>
