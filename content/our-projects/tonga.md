The Renewable Energy Project will help Tonga rapidly move from its heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation (about 90%) to using clean and renewable energy resources that are low carbon and climate resilient.

A GCF grant of $29.9 million, combined with a $12.2 million grant from ADB, plus other co-financing, will fund the installation of clean-electricity facilities and the construction of a mini-grid system on the outer islands, thus enabling the country to shift away from fossil fuels and toward climate-resilient energy systems. Support will also be provided for capacity building and community engagement to increase sustainability and strengthen ownership. Through the project, Tonga looks forward to achieving its targets of generating 50% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020 and 70% by 2030. It expects as well to reduce its power line losses to 9% (from 18% in 2010), and to bring down its carbon dioxide emissions by 13,616 metric tons per year. 

The Tonga project will introduce several innovations, not only at the regional but also at the global level. Battery storage at scale is new to Tonga and the region, and relatively new globally. Much still has to be learned about such things as technological suitability, performance, integration into transmission networks, and operation and maintenance (O&M). The project will also be the first to install battery energy storage systems (BESSs) with two different functionalities—load shifting, to offset renewable generation at the planned renewable-energy facilities in Tongatapu; and grid stabilization, to manage the impact of fluctuations in grid generation and thus allow the integration of more renewable generation while maintaining power quality and system reliability. 

Installing three renewable-energy technologies—wind power, solar photovoltaic, and BESSs—in the relatively small grid will be another innovation. Tonga Power will gain experience in using the most cost-effective and fully integrated approaches to designing renewable-energy and battery energy storage systems, and in developing management systems to integrate renewable and intermittent energies into the grid. 

Other innovations will be an expected long-term O&M contract between the government and Tonga Power, including the training of local communities in daily O&M, for the long-term sustainability of the facilities to be constructed on the outer islands under the project; gender training, which could lead to long-term employment opportunities for female workers under the project; and more commercially oriented accounting practices and tariff setting. 

New regulation or legislation may be needed to cover the introduction of large-scale BESSs, the climate-proofing requirements of all investments and physical infrastructure, and the integration of diverse renewable-energy technologies. Measures will be initiated to address this need, with support from the project for sector reforms and for the promotion of private sector participation.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The project has been designed to help move Tonga from its current energy pathway that is almost entirely (about 90%) dependent on imported fossil fuels for power generation to a pathway using clean and renewable energy resources that is low-carbon and climate resilient.
