The project will develop a sustainable urban transport system in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, economic and financial center, and main seaport, directly benefiting 1.5 million people. It will construct a 30-kilometer fully segregated, state-of-the-art bus rapid transit (BRT) corridor and associated facilities, including sidewalks, access roads, on-street parking, mixed-traffic as well as non-motorized transport lanes, high-capacity drainage, and a BRT depot. 

Direct-service operations will allow BRT vehicles to travel along the corridor in the busiest parts of the city and off-corridor in less congested areas, thus expanding the system’s reach and capacity, reducing the need for passenger transfers, and increasing ridership and financial sustainability. A negotiation process to be established under the project will enable existing operators to participate in the new system. 

The BRT system will be powered completely by biomethane, produced from cattle waste available within the larger urban zone of Karachi. Energy-efficient streetlights and intelligent traffic management systems will be installed. The project will also have an environmental and social mitigation component, covering environmental management and resettlement planning and bus industry restructuring, and will build capacity for effective project management and sustainable BRT operations. 

Major time savings for future BRT passengers and vehicle operating cost savings are projected, as are improvements in air quality and noise levels, a significant reduction in carbon emissions (by about 2.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, or tCO<sub>2</sub>e, over the project’s 30-year life) leading to better health for Karachi's citizens and to climate-change mitigation, and universal access for women, children, and the disabled at all stations and in buses. Karachi will become safer and more livable, private sector investment will increase, and gender equity will progress.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The project has basically two novel approaches which have a significant replication potential:

a). Usage of biomethane hybrid buses reducing the amount of biomethane required and resulting in 0-emission bus fleets with very low local pollution levels. Biomethane usage is not new, however using biomethane in developing country cities for urban buses on a non-pilot scale is a novelty. Combing biomethane with hybrid buses for a BRT will also be a first of its kind. This combination is considered critical as biomethane is relatively scarce in urban settings, can be costly to produce and buses use a large amount of energy. 

b). The project will integrate non-motorized transport facilities including cycle-lanes and e-pedicabs into the BRT system. A good monitoring of the impact of this approach will allow for improved planning and dissemination to other cities in Pakistan and around the world.
