### Overview

Growing challenges in greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollution are driving countries to embrace sustainable urban mobility models to address issues from rapidly growing urban transport systems.

The E-Mobility Program aims to promote a transformational shift to climate resilient zero emission mobility systems in urban cities. It integrates e-bus deployment with sustainable low-carbon and resilient urban public transport development and climate-proofing measures to help safeguard urban transport infrastructure and enhance resilience against extreme weather events that can potentially damage infrastructure and disrupt urban transport networks.  

The program seeks to mitigate GHG emissions amounting to about 11.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2eq) over a 25-year period.

### Implementation

The program provides technical assistance and investment in climate resilient urban transport infrastructure and large-scale deployment of battery electric buses combined with mode-shift measures to more convenient and contemporary public transportation systems, including non-motorized transport and electric micro-mobility in the seven countries. 

The program supports countries that are ready to undergo paradigm shifts in sustainability, replicability, and scalability, and also contribute towards a modal shift towards public and non-motorized transport. The paradigm shift of the program is encapsulated by addressing deployment risks inherent to nascent markets and demonstrating proof-of-concept in the target markets.

The program has four components, namely:

1.	Increasing climate resilience of urban transport Infrastructure by implementing climate adaptation measures based on the cities’ vulnerabilities to climate stressors. Measures are structured around the concepts of “sponge city,” enhancing stormwater drainage with measures such as bioswales or permeable pavements, and “shade city” to reduce the impact of heat waves, including measures such as urban forests or passive solar design for bus stops.

2.	Deploying public transport and non-motorized transport (NMT) to foster mode shift to low-carbon transport. The construction of at least 20 kilometers of exclusive cycle lanes and NMT measures, and the implementation of urban mobility measures such as pedestrianization, bus lanes, and route restructuring are some of the activities under this component.  

3.	Deploying electric bus fleets with innovative business models to enable their mass application. This includes large-scale purchase of battery electric buses in the program cities. 

4.	Providing technical assistance and project structuring support to projects that will potentially receive financial assistance. This includes activities such as: application of methodology for climate risk identification; development and implementation of knowledge and technology transfer, including business models for e-bus systems; design and fostering of E-mobility conducive policies and ecosystems, including realization of electric vehicle roadmaps; training and capacity building of stakeholders, knowledge sharing about best practices, and dissemination of successful interventions; realization of urban interventions with a gender perspective; and detailed design.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The paradigm shift of the program in terms of scale is a change from the current reliance on fossil-fuel powered transportation with high vulnerability of urban transport infrastructure to the impacts of climate change towards electrified climate resilient transportation means.

The program fosters a structural shift towards low-carbon, resilient sustainable and attractive public transport systems which can reverse the declining public transport mode share trend and increase resilience of the urban form. Barriers towards mass electric vehicle deployment can successfully be eliminated or reduced through program interventions. 

The program serves as a market accelerator for EV investments, providing an e-mobility conducive policy environment, innovative business models, lower performance and income risks, and the entrance of new market players. 

The program creates added value through knowledge management, interchange of experience, and the creation of a critical mass of commercial EV deployment in various countries.
