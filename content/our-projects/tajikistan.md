The State Agency for Hydrometeorology (Hydromet) is the climate and weather agency of Tajikistan, a Central Asian country highly prone to climate-related extreme weather events. About 70% of the population is rural and relies on agriculture as primary source of income.

To protect the vital interests of individuals, society, and the state from natural hazards, the agency is mandated to provide hydrometeorological information to government and civil society stakeholders, including warnings about extreme weather events related to climate change, and to ensure the functioning of the state monitoring network and the system for collecting, processing, and disseminating hydrometeorological information.

However, Hydromet has inadequate capacity to fulfill its public service mandate. Like many other post-Soviet institutions, it has a meager budget and crumbling infrastructure, and is largely unable to recruit and keep competent professional staff, given the uncompetitive salaries it can offer as a state agency.

Its patchy monitoring network is labor-intensive, relies on third-party predictive modeling and satellite imagery, and does not integrate a risk-based approach to assessing hydrologic impact. Two-way communication with customers, for collaborative product development and service improvement, is poor. As might be expected, stakeholder dissatisfaction with Hydromet forecasting is high, and fee-based services are difficult to market.

The project is designed to address the underlying institutional barriers and weaknesses, and develop Hydromet into a sustainable and well-resourced institution providing forecasting services that are timely and accurate. All of Tajikistan stands to benefit. Direct benefits are expected for individuals, community organizations, and government agencies in the Pyanj River Basin.

Over a period of 5 years, the project will modernize the Hydromet campus and facilities, develop a strategy for sustainable operations and maintenance, convert the agency into a semiautonomous government entity with the flexibility to set staff salaries and retain additional entrepreneurial revenue from the sale of weather forecast information products. The project will support the development and implementation of a fee-based service delivery model to strengthen financial viability.

It will also build capacity for extreme-weather forecasting and warning, and organize gender-sensitive consultations to enhance community awareness of flood risks and the use of improved flood forecasts for better disaster preparedness. A knowledge-sharing program will be established with two ongoing ADB projects in the Pyanj River Basin, and with regional and international partners, to sustain capacity development.

### Paradigm shift potential

The project will facilitate a significant shift in the funding and provision of information and forecasting services in Tajikistan. The model is also replicable in other hydrometeorology agencies around Central Asia.
