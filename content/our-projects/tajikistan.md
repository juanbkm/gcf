### Overview

Tajikistan is a country with a landlocked mountainous geography that is especially prone to extreme weather events resulting to floods and landslides. Its economy heavily depends on natural resources and climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, making it highly vulnerable to climate change.

To make informed decisions in managing climate risks, Tajikistan depends on accurate and timely hydrological and meteorological data and information. However, its State Agency for Hydrometeorology of Tajikistan (Hydromet), overseen by the State Agency for Hydrometeorology, faces challenges in data collection, analysis, and dissemination due to inadequate infrastructure and technical capacity.

The project supports the modernization of Hydromet that will enable the agency to provide timely and robust information for development planning and for empowering communities.

### Implementation

A $11.5-million grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support the development of effective hydrological and meteorological data and information in Tajikistan. The project has an estimated lifespan of 30 years, with around 8.7 million people projected to benefit.

Key activities include improving the agency’s operations center and updating its business model towards increased management and financial autonomy. It will also help address Hydromet’s institutional weaknesses by supporting its legal and structural transformation into a sustainable, well-resourced, and reliable national agency for meteorology and hydrology which will strengthen Tajikistan’s disaster and climate resilience initiatives.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

GCF has been supporting projects in developing countries like Tajikistan to strengthen their use of climate information systems and help them face recurring climate-related extreme weather events, particularly floods and landslides. 

This project demonstrates paradigm shift potential through the following:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved forecasting and early warning</strong>: With the installation of the SmartMet system, the process of forecasting and preventing natural disasters has improved at Hydromet. Its reported probability of flood forecasts accuracy is 80% and the percentage of false alarms is now down to 20%.</li>
  <li><strong>Building climate resilience</strong>: Various sectors such as agriculture, water resources management, and energy, can now make informed decisions about planning, investment, and resource allocation with the aid of Hydromet’s improved data and analysis on climate change impacts. This can also help communities and the government develop strategies for climate change adaptation.</li>
  <li><strong>Gender empowerment</strong>: The project promoted gender inclusivity through the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Creation of a Women's Development Group consisting of 25 people</li>
      <li>Participation of several women in regional and international workshops and events, improving knowledge and skills</li>
      <li>26% of women held managerial positions in the central office and 10.6% in local regions</li>
      <li>Women specialists at Hydromet process, prepare, and disseminate daily hydrometeorological data.</li>
      <li>Of the 16 laboratory specialists involved in the project's activities and received training, 13 are young women.</li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
