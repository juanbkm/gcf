Approved by the GCF in October 2017, the project is expected to transform Nauru’s 111-year-old boat harbor in Aiwo from a dysfunctional facility into an efficient, climate-resilient, and the country’s first fully functioning international port. This will ensure economic, cultural, and social connectivity for Nauru within the region and globally.

The project will also help reform port governance and management, notably through the institution of appropriate and equitable tariffs and improvements in revenue collection. It will also build the capacity of the Nauru Port Authority (NPA) through the hiring of qualified staff and on-the-job and specific training for financial, economic, and institutional sustainability.

Nauru lies 40 kilometers south of the equator, far from all international partners and markets. The country depends almost entirely on its port for supplies of food, energy, and most other essentials.

All infrastructure will be constructed with the highest standards and have a minimum design life of 50 years under the most extreme climate-change scenarios. Breakwater, wharf, and foreshore construction will have features that take into account elevated infrastructure to raise the crest level and make the facilities more resistant to wave overtopping and damage from rising seas.

These enhancements will give oceangoing vessels year-round access to the Aiwo port. The time ships spend at sea, and, therefore, their shipping costs, fuel use, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, will be considerably reduced as a result. A reduction of 535,400 metric tons in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is expected. Aiwo will become a more attractive port of call for shipping companies.

New opportunities will be created for development, employment, and poverty reduction. Basic needs can be met more affordably and public health will improve as fresher produce and nourishing food, as well as medicines, are able to enter the country with greater regularity.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

Ports are at the forefront of infrastructure at risk of climate change. The project can provide replicable solutions for the many Pacific islands that face similar challenges. Reliable maritime connectivity can transform Nauru’s society, economy, and future.
