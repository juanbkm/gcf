Decades of exponential population growth and rural–urban migration have led to widespread unplanned development in Ulaanbaatar, mostly in its ger (traditional Mongolian dwelling) districts, where an estimated 60% of the capital city’s population (2018) of about 800,000 lives.

These districts have generally substandard connections to urban infrastructure and services, and are highly vulnerable to climate change, as manifested in increased livestock mortality due to droughts and harsh winters, and livestock productivity losses as grassland biomass production has dwindled with rising temperatures and decreased rainfall. Dwellings are poorly insulated and inefficiently heated by coal- and biomass-fired stoves.

This 9-year, $544 million project was conceived to support the planning and construction of climate-resilient and low-carbon eco-districts in the ger areas, in the face of a variety of financial and technical barriers, such as the absence of incentives, the unaffordability of equipment, and low awareness of the importance of generating and using efficient and sustainable energy.

Ten thousand affordable and energy-efficient housing units connected to the main urban service networks will be built, and 100 hectares of ger areas will be redeveloped into eco-districts with climate-resilient and low-carbon urban infrastructure, public facilities, and social housing units. The new houses will be better insulated and will be fitted with solar photovoltaic panels.

Investments will also be made in greenhouses for the sustainable and efficient cultivation of plants for food in climate-controlled conditions; in flood protection for houses; in protection against the heightened risk of earthquakes; in flood-resistant roads; in gardens and parks; and in climate-proof water supply, heating and lighting, waste management, and other urban service facilities.

Core subprojects identified in the Bayankhoshuu West and Selbe East subcenters (economic hubs) will construct 55,630 square meters (m2) of townhouses and low-rise buildings with an average annual specific energy consumption for heating of 150 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per m2 (versus the previous 395 kWh/m2), install 7,500 m2 of solar photovoltaic panels, build 9,100 m2 of greenhouses, and expand secondary and tertiary networks and urban service networks.

Technical training will strengthen the capabilities of developers, construction companies, and suppliers of equipment and building materials. Capacity to conduct proper monitoring, reporting, and validation will be developed. Improved or new policies and regulations will be recommended to upgrade urban planning standards, enhance synchronized planning and action among the government’s housing agencies, and address barriers to mitigation and adaptation investment.

Through coordination with the mitigation and adaptation initiatives of development partners, such as the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, the project will be able to make the most of related knowledge and best practices available.

Incentives offered to promote private investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts will include a fund set up for developers, mortgage support, and coupons representing compensation for land and buildings owned, for use toward the cost of new housing.

### Paradigm shift potential

In order to successfully measure the paradigm shift potential of this project, key impact potential indicators for both mitigation and adaptation will be used to measure how this project can be replicated across Ulaanbaatar.  This method is a conservative one because it doesn’t present the opportunities to roll out to the rest of Mongolia and outside the country.  This AHURP method for dealing with the influx of migrants resulting from climate-induced disasters (and creeping loss of productivity due to gradual climate change) and the reduction of heat losses in buildings could be very well replicated in other countries, for example in the northern part of Central Asia, North and Northeast Asia, and other mountainous areas throughout the world. 

ADB will support replication, both inside Mongolia and outside Mongolia, through the preparation of dissemination materials highlighting the accomplishments and results of AHURP and lessons learned. The materials produced shall be a combination of knowledge papers and project briefs. In addition ADB will develop relevant pilots both within Mongolia (focused outside of Ulaanbaatar) and within ADB’s developing member countries to initiate the replication of AHURP. ADB’s ongoing and planned affordable climate-resilient and low-carbon housing projects will be an excellent vehicle for this purpose.
