The project, part of a regional ADB program that also includes the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, was approved for GCF cofinancing in February 2018. It is intended to reduce climate-change vulnerability and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions at each stage of agricultural value chains in the rice, maize, cassava, and mango industries, and increase crop resilience and productivity, as well as agricultural competitiveness and household incomes in the project areas.

The project will operate in the provinces of Kampong Cham, Tbong Khmum, Kampot, and Takeo provinces—all with established transport links between production and markets, but also a record of agricultural losses due to extreme climate events. In August 2011, for example, heavy rains and overflow from the Mekong River destroyed crops and communal infrastructure, and resulted in damage and losses of at least $624 million. A 1-in-35-year drought in 2015–2016, on the other hand, reduced rainfall by over 50% and severely affected yields, contributing to temporary food shortages.

Cambodia’s unique geography and hydrologic conditions—low-lying plains amid encircling mountain ranges, and water systems prone to high seasonal variability—plus its overreliance on water resources, agriculture, and other climate-sensitive sectors, and its low capacity to adapt, following years of brute conflict, render the country largely defenseless against climate variations and climate change.

The project will help the most vulnerable populations living in flood- or drought-prone areas, women, rural communities, and the agriculture sector. Resources will be invested in climate-resilient irrigation and water management structures and rural roads, climate-controlled storage units, and energy-efficient processing facilities. Capacity will be strengthened, enabling an environment for sound agribusiness policy.

Promoting renewable energy and introducing bio-digesters will lower GHG emissions by at least 240,000 tCO2e by 2024. Using climate-smart agriculture (CSA) techniques, such as cutbacks in tillage, restoration of soil cover, and water, nutrient, and pesticide management, will result in an additional 3.25 million tCO2e avoided.

Provincial resource and training centers will be built, and formal training and on-farm demonstrations will be held for agriculture officials, cooperatives, farmers, and water-user communities, to encourage the use of CSA and other approaches to reducing GHG emissions, sustainable rice platform and good agricultural practice standards, and management and O&M procedures. Training and capacity building will also be provided to commercial banks and microfinance institutions in targeted areas, to promote green financing, reduce risk aversion, and strengthen links with borrowers and input and service providers.

In addition, the project could catalyze long-term investment in emission reduction technologies or improvements in farming productivity and resilience.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

Transformative impact will be achieved through the adoption of policies and standards that will enable investments in climate-smart agribusinesses, technologies promoting CSA and information and communication technologies, and crop-centric public–private partnerships, and through an increase in institutional capacity to support climate-resilient agriculture and maintain climate-proof infrastructure.

This project expects to contribute to large-scale transformative impacts with the use of up to date technologies with a high potential for leap-frogging, including for example, mechanization, CSA and elements of precision farming, laser land levelling and the use of information technology to upscale the delivery of climate and market information services. In selecting and deploying such technologies, the project will carefully assess lessons learned from previous projects. The quality of technologies will be ensured through use of certified companies and/or products. 

The project will also leverage stakeholder behavioural change of communities and the private sector through the introduction of new financial and risk sharing mechanisms such as green financing or crop insurance, as well as through awareness raising.
