As ADB’s first GCF project, the project was approved in November 2015, and was among the first to be approved by the GCF Board.

At a total cost of $405.1 million, the nine-year project will build infrastructure to increase accessibility to safe water and sewerage services within the Greater Suva Area. The project will replace water meters to reduce nonrevenue water, estimated at 50% by the project implementing agency, the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF); and provide policy and regulatory support to improve the management of the water and sewerage sector and the sustainability of service delivery. Around 290,000 people are estimated to benefit directly or indirectly from the project, over 30% of the population of the service area.

Just over half of Fiji’s population lives in urban areas, with the number projected to increase to over 60% by 2030. Despite being assigned priority in national development plans, urban infrastructure and services have not kept pace, exacerbating urban sprawl and environmental degradation. Extreme drought, flooding and rising sea levels have made increased the costs for the government to provide urban services.

The project is designed to address these service access and sustainability needs. For improved water resource and supply resilience, new intake structures will be constructed higher in the catchment area and on a larger river system than the current intake. The new intake location reduces the risk of saltwater intrusion as sea levels rise, and from reductions in river flows caused by drought. The water supply system will also gain flexibility to accommodate increases in water demand and changes in supply source yield. Upgraded wastewater treatment infrastructure and a wider sewerage network will enable more households to be served while reducing pollution loads on receiving waters.

The project will support programs for nonrevenue water reduction, water demand management, liquid trade waste management, and capacity building and institutional strengthening for WAF.

Reliable and sustainable long-term operations and maintenance practices will be enhanced through a Design-Build-Operate (DBO) contracting arrangement.

The project comprises a combination of loans (an estimated $153.2 million from ADB and $70.8 million from the European Investment Bank) and grant financing ($31 million from the GCF). This will allow Fiji to institute key adaptation measures without sacrificing other high-priority development needs.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

It is critical that climate change mitigation and adaptation measures are integrated into normal operating procedures, particularly in any new water and sewerage infrastructure investments. Successful and measurable demonstration of these proposed climate investments will have a genuine potential to drive a social change initiative within the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), the government, and relevant sector agencies so they can use this as a basis for future strategic planning and decision making in water and wastewater sector investments. Through this project, WAF will acquire knowledge and experience in developing long-term investment strategies that integrate adaptation and mitigation considerations. These practices can then be replicated in other urban centers around the country such as Nadi, Lautoka, and Lambasa.

Fiji is at the forefront of the Pacific Island countries in terms of experience in water and wastewater management. Lessons can be shared at the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association, of which Fiji is an active member. This will enhance the replication of best practices in urban areas in the Pacific with similar geophysical characteristics, economic fragility, limited technical capacities, and climate vulnerabilities.
