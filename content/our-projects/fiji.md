As ADB’s first GCF project, the project was approved in November 2015, and was among the first to be approved by the GCF Board.

With a total cost of $405.1 million, the nine-year project is expected to build infrastructure to make safe water and sewerage services more accessible within the Greater Suva Area; replace water meters to reduce nonrevenue water, estimated at 50% by the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), the project implementing agency; and provide policy and regulatory support to improve the management of the water and sewerage sector and the sustainability of service delivery. Around 290,000 people—32% of the population of the service area in 2018—are seen to benefit directly or indirectly from the project.

A little more than half of Fiji’s population is urban. This proportion is seen to increase to about 61% by 2030. Despite being assigned priority in national development plans, urban infrastructure and services have not kept pace, worsening urban sprawl and environmental degradation. Extreme drought and flooding, as well as rising sea levels, have made it more costly for the government to provide urban services.

The project is designed to answer these service access and sustainability needs. For improved water resource and supply resilience, new intake structures will be constructed higher in the catchment area and on a larger river system than the current intake. The new intake location reduces the risk of saltwater intrusion as sea levels rise, as well as from reductions in river flows caused by drought. The water supply system will also gain flexibility to accommodate increases in water demand and changes in supply source yield. Upgraded wastewater treatment infrastructure and a wider sewerage network will enable more households to be served, while reducing pollution loads on receiving waters.

The project will support programs for nonrevenue water reduction, water demand management, liquid trade waste management, as well as capacity building and institutional strengthening for WAF.

Reliable and sustainable long-term operations and maintenance practices will be enhanced through a Design-Build-Operate (DBO) contracting arrangement.

The project counts on a combination of loans (an estimated $153.2 million from ADB and $70.8 million from the European Investment Bank) and grant financing ($31 million from the GCF). This will allow this small island developing state to institute key adaptation measures without sacrificing other high-priority development needs.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

It is critical that climate change mitigation and adaptation measures are integrated into normal operating procedures, particularly in any new water and sewerage infrastructure investments. Successful and measurable demonstration of these proposed climate investments will have a genuine potential to drive a social change initiative within the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), the government, and relevant sector agencies so they can use this as a basis for future strategic planning and decision making in water and wastewater sector investments. Through this project, WAF will acquire knowledge and experience in developing long-term investment strategies that integrate adaptation and mitigation considerations. These practices can then be replicated in other urban centers around the country such as Nadi, Lautoka, and Lambasa.

Fiji is at the forefront of the Pacific Island countries in terms of experience in water and wastewater management. Lessons can be shared at the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association, of which Fiji is an active member. This will enhance the replication of best practices in urban areas in the Pacific with similar geophysical characteristics, economic fragility, limited technical capacities, and climate vulnerabilities.
