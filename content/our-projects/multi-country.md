### Overview

The impacts of climate change are far-reaching: creating food insecurity, water scarcity, and loss of livelihood; and putting the health and lives of millions of people at risk. Poor and vulnerable populations, especially women, the youth, the elderly, and migrant workers, will face the brunt of these climate impacts and require targeted support. Estimates suggest that climate change could push more than 100 million people globally in developing countries below the poverty line by 2030, with Asia and the Pacific being one of the main hot spots. 

Estimates show that global annual adaptation costs in developing countries alone are in the range of $70 billion and expected to reach $140 billion–$300 billion by 2030 and $280 billion–$500 billion by 2050.  A key objective of climate adaptation finance is to support adaptation measures that improve the well-being of the poorest, who are the hardest hit by the impacts of climate change. However, estimates suggest that little support explicitly seeks to support   local climate action. 

To help address this need, in 2021, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched the Community Resilience Partnership Program (CRPP)  which aims to strengthen climate resilience in poor and vulnerable communities in Asia and the Pacific region by scaling up climate adaptation investments at the local level, especially in those at the nexus of climate change, poverty reduction, and gender. CRPP’s efforts contribute to ADB’s aims to deliver US$100 billion in cumulative climate finance from its own resources between 2019 and 2030.

The CRPP is a regional program to mobilize large-scale public investments that support community-level adaptation of poor and vulnerable people, develop national and local policies and initiatives that promote financing for community-led adaptation, and increase the meaningful participation of poor people, especially women, in resilience-related decision-making. 

### Implementation

The CRPP is operationalized through the Community Resilience Financing Partnership Facility (CRFPF), which has two separate but interlinked components:

1.	The CRPP Trust Fund: a multi-donor trust fund administered by ADB and financed by Agence Française de Développement, Nordic Development Fund, and the Government of the United Kingdom, through its Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office. The trust fund focuses on upstream support to strengthen the enabling environment required for financing and implementing local adaptation measures at scale.

2.	The CRPP Investment Fund: Cofinanced by ADB and the GCF, the fund focuses on the efficient rollout of local adaptation measures through downstream investment programs. The investment fund will provide support to seven countries in the Asia and the Pacific region: Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu.

The GCF Board approved US$120 million for the CRPP at its 37th board meeting on 25 October 2023. 

<blockquote>
  <p>Scaling up local climate adaptation investments is essential to protecting vulnerable communities and promoting inclusive and sustainable development amid growing climate risk in Asia and the Pacific. The CRPP is our long-term, programmatic response that pinpoints adaptation measures that address climate, poverty, and gender challenges. The CRPP is designed for implementation over a 10-year period from 2021 to 2031 and we thank the GCF for supporting the program.</p>

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The CRPP is intended to help countries and communities in the region scale up adaptation measures that address the nexus between climate change, poverty, and gender inequality at the community level.

The program will focus on three key areas: i) Strengthening institutional and community capacity to deliver adaptation measures at the local level; ii) improving information and systems for delivering climate-risk informed investments at scale; and iii) providing climate-resilient pro-poor livelihoods and infrastructure investments.

By focusing attention on vulnerable communities, the CRPP will foster a stronger sense of ownership over local adaptation endeavors to ultimately increase the collective benefits derived from these efforts. 

It will also support sustainable outcomes by integrating climate considerations into development policies, programs, and decision-making processes across a wide range of social and economic sectors and levels of government. 

In doing so, the CRPP aims to support countries to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the Sustainable Development Goals.
