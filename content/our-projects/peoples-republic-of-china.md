The program is a pilot run of an estimated $1.5-billion transformational and disruptive financing mechanism backing the efforts of Shandong province to decarbonize its economy and reduce its climate vulnerability. Shandong leads the country in energy consumption. It also leads in the number of vehicles responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. The province looks forward to reaching its peak in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by around 2027, ahead of the national target of 2030 under the country’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions.

The program will help make selected climate-resilient subprojects in the province bankable by providing funding support for up-front risk management, and for the promotion of advanced technologies and an integrated approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Funds from private, institutional, and commercial sources will supplement catalytic funding from international financing institutions, including ADB.

Among the subprojects being considered are the manufacture of safe, clean, and energy-efficient precast concrete frames for climate-resilient construction; the establishment of a technology park to bring together the production, distribution, and storage of hydrogen fuel (a substitute for fossil fuels); and the construction of a two-kilometer prototype solar road with wireless charging of vehicles while driving. 

### Paradigm Shift Potential

The Shandong Green Development Fund (SGDF) will be replicated in and beyond Shandong province, first in priority provinces and then at the national level. It should be noted that the SGDF is affiliated with SDIHG, the investment vehicle of the Shandong provincial government charged with the structural transformation and decarbonization of the provincial economy. As such, the provincial Development and Reform Commission (DRC) is both represented on the board of SDIHG and has close relations with SGDF staff. The SGDF can demonstrate effective approaches to the development of climate subprojects. These approaches can be fed directly into the policy-making process.

Lessons learned and processes put in place with SGDF will be applied to other provinces and beyond the PRC. For example, ADB started to replicate the concept through the Green Finance Catalyzing Facility in Indonesia for 2020 ($500 million under discussion before upscaling in ASEAN through ADB’s lending program).

The Program aims at a leverage over 5 times the size of SGDF. Catalytic finance from GCF, ADB, AFD, KfW, and potentially others is used only to provide the catalyst for other PIC funding, altering the risk profile as perceived by the private sector and institutional financiers, both as participants in initial financing and in refinancing.
