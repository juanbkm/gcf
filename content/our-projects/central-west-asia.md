### Overview

Central and West Asia (CWA) is one of the fastest-warming regions globally, with average temperatures rising by 0.2°C–0.4°C per decade. If trends hold, more than 50% of glacier volume in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges could be lost by 2100. This existential threat to water, food, and energy security across the region endangers the livelihoods and food security of over 340 million people across nine countries in the CWA, particularly women, smallholder farmers, and micro-entrepreneurs who depend on glacier-fed rivers for crops and hydropower. Without urgent intervention, communities risk worsening poverty, displacement, and instability. 

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched the Glaciers to Farms (G2F) Programme, a 10-year adaptation initiative to strengthen water, agriculture and community resilience in CWA. The program will mobilize up to US$3.5 billion, including grants and loans from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to safeguard communities heavily reliant on cryosphere-fed water systems—the Naryn, Pyanj, Kura and Swat.  The Programme will invest in modernized irrigation, watershed management, water-efficient technologies, early warning systems, and adaptive social protection schemes and health services. 

### Implementation

G2F will connect upstream glacier monitoring with downstream efforts in water management, agriculture, and disaster risk reduction to build resilience from the glacier to the farm. G2F is expected to benefit 13 million people. It marks a major step toward systemic, science-based resilience building in fragile mountain regions increasingly threatened by glacial retreat.

The programme is 100% focused on climate adaptation and aligns with national priorities, including National Adaptation Plans (NAP), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The project has several components, including climate-informed planning tools, the development of bankable adaptation projects, and new financing approaches such as outcome-based resilience bonds. 

GCF Project Preparation Facility (PPF) support was provided to conduct feasibility studies and stakeholder consultations across all nine countries, which was instrumental in refining the programme’s design.

### Paradigm Shift Potential

G2F aims to expand the capacity within the Ministries of Finance, Planning and Environment to apply climate budgeting and screening tools. It will support the creation of infrastructure for climate finance, mentoring agriculture enterprises, and design of cross-border pilot projects.

G2F is expected to deliver substantial, measurable improvements in climate resilience for communities and ecosystems. The programme aims to reduce the vulnerability of around 45 million people across nine countries by providing more stable water and food supplies, infrastructure that can withstand shocks, stronger social safety nets, and healthier ecosystems.
